                            <p>This platform was built to solve the problem of the disconnect of what is taught in the classroom of various nigerian institutions and the work done in the field. The platform bridges the gap between theory and pratice in the field of electrical engineering, specifically transmission.
                              The platform does so by allowing users to be able to learn from one another by sharing videos of their experiences on the field, and also creating lectures on various topics. The platform also allows users to submit lecture requests on specific topics. Anyone who is knowledgable in the topic of the lecture request can create a lecture in response to the request. Feel free to contribute to the platform in any way possible, remember the quality of engineers in a nation is dependent on the co-operation of engineers within that nation.</p>
